# FinSecure Loan Default Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
**FinSecure** is a peer-to-peer lending company that connects borrowers with investors. This project aims to minimize financial losses by accurately predicting which loan applicants are likely to default. 

Using historical loan application data, I have developed a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict the probability of a loan being paid back in full.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset `loan_data.csv` contains historical data on loan applicants.
- **Target Variable**: `loan_paid_back` (1 = Paid Back, 0 = Default)
- **Features**: Annual income, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, loan amount, interest rate, grade, employment status, etc.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**: Removed non-predictive columns (`id`).
- **Encoding**: Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables (e.g., `loan_purpose`, `education_level`).
- **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features (e.g., `annual_income`, `loan_amount`) using StandardScaler to ensure equal weightage.

### 2. Model Selection
- **Architecture**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Reasoning**: Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features (like income vs. debt) and its robustness against overfitting compared to single decision trees.

## 📊 Results

The model was evaluated using the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)** metric.

- **Overall AUC Score**: **0.9076** (Outstanding predictive power)

### Subgroup Analysis (Fairness Check)
To ensure the model is fair, performance was tested across different demographics:

| Segment | Category | AUC Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Education** | Bachelor's | 0.9081 |
| | Master's | 0.9054 |
| | High School | 0.9062 |
| **Loan Purpose** | **Top Performing**: Education | 0.9196 |
| | **Bottom Performing**: Car | 0.8971 |

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
